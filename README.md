# VoltDB - in Memory DB
This repository represents a good example of a VoldDB - in Memory Database.

In-memory databases (IMDBs) shine in scenarios where lightning-fast response times and real-time data processing are crucial.

## **In-Memory Databases (IMDBs):**
	Use Cases: IoT data processing, e-commerce, gaming, real-time security, telecom, and mobile advertising.
	Advantages: Real-time responsiveness, low latency, and efficient handling of dynamic data.
## **Why Choose IMDBs:**
	Performance: Faster read/write operations due to RAM storage.
	Scalability: Easy horizontal scaling with more RAM servers.
	Cost and Use Case: Consider cost and specific application needs.
## **Persistent Databases (e.g., Oracle, PostgreSQL):**
	Advantages: Complex queries, data durability, and mature features.
	Considerations: Higher latency, complex sharding for scalability.
